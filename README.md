# Projects for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program

To install and launch each project, navigate to the respective folder and run `npm install` and `npm start` in the terminal.

If there is an `api-server` subfolder in the project, cd into it and run `npm install` and `npm start` (or `node server.js` in case npm-start does not work) to start the local server for that project.
